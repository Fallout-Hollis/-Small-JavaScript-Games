A collections of a bunch of small JavaScript Games I wrote.

Guess My Number -- A game where you guess a randomized number if you get it you win!

Rock Paper Scissors -- A little self explanatory but you choose one of the three the computer chooses one of the three randomly and you see who wins.

Pig Game -- Roll a Dice against another person dice rolls add up you can choose to hold built up points or risk it for more if you roll a 1 it will delete all earned 
  points not being held and will switch to other player allowing them to roll dice, first to 100 wins.
